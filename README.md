# Where's Waldo - An Image Tagging Game

## Description

This is an application inspired in the Where's Waldo games.

You win the game by finding all the characters available in each map. 

The main purpose of this application was to learn and practice using react and other front-end technologies. So, for the front-end I used React.js with the TypeScript template. This was my first time using TypeScript, but I have experience working with JavaScript and with typed languages such as C++ and Java, so learning TypeScript was pretty simple.
