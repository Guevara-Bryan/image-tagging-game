## Description

This is an application inspired in the Where's Waldo games.

You win the game by finding all the characters available in each map. Try to get the best time possible and see your current position on the leaderboard.

The main purpose of this application was to learn and practice using react and other front-end technologies.

For the front-end I used React.js with the TypeScript template.This was my first time using TypeScript, but I have experience working with JavaScript and with typed languages such as C++ and Java, so learning TypeScript was not too dificult. I also used BootStrap to help me do the styling quicker.

As for the backend, I used a Backend As A Service (BASS). Specifically I used Firebase's Firestore, Storage, and Hosting services.

## What I learned

For me this was a great learning experience as I got to work with some technologies that I had not worked before, namely, Firebase, BootStrap, and Typescript. Though I had experience working with typed languages having to use types in the context of a web application and creating user interfaces was challenging at first but I quickly grew to like the type safety and thestructure that TypeScript provides.

This was also my first time using BootStrap and I really liked it. In some earlier projects having to write lots of CSS was a major time consuming task. This time around I decided to try BootStrap and It helped me reduce the time it took to add styles to the page.

Using Firebase was a totally new experience for me, but it taught me a lot about what the backend of a website does and particularly what the user API should look like. I look forward to emulating the best practices I learned from it when I create my own backend services.
